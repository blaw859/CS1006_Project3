# CS1006_Project3
A game simulator and optimiser for the StarCraft2 Protoss race

## Notes
* We don't actually need specific instances of unit objects all you need are the 
economic aspects of them in order to perform the calculations that need to be done.
Only one instance is needed as a reference object
